## Benefits of this project
Working on this site will help me **practice practice practice** HTML, CSS and possibly JS (if I get crafty :thinking:)

## Hurddles 
The dificulties about this project are as follows:
- Writing the code
  - Adding my own personal touch with out getting to *deep in the weeds*
  - **CSS** positioning and size specifically
- Making sure that I include all requirements
  - I'm looking at you  [sticky footer](https://css-tricks.com/couple-takes-sticky-footer/)
- Getting enough sleep
  - [8 hrs :pray:](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0608/2925/products/Month6_1024x1024.jpg)
